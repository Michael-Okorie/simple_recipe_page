## 🔨 My Process

### 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS** custom properties
- **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first** workflow

### 💡 What I Learned

Working on this project improved my understanding of:

- Structuring semantic HTML properly for better accessibility.
- Implementing responsive layouts using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.

Here’s a snippet of code I’m proud of:

```css
.card{
    width: 450px;
    height: auto;
    padding: 30px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

This helped me create a clean and efficient layout for the recipe page!

### 🚀 Continued Development

I plan to continue improving by:

- Deepening my understanding of **CSS animations and transitions**.
- Exploring **advanced accessibility techniques**.
- Enhancing my **JavaScript interactivity** skills for future projects.

### 📚 Useful Resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A complete guide that helped me structure my layout effectively.
